            <p>We've seen first-hand that one of the biggest barriers to solving the Flint water crisis has been a lack of coordination between relief efforts and resources. This means that on-the-ground organizations don't always have enough information to do their jobs, and new online tools are released every week that rely on limited government data about a small number of official distribution sites. The result is that resources never make it to some of the most under-resourced folks in this community we call home.</p><br>

            <p>We want to equalize access to relief resources for all Flint residents, so we're offering our up-to-date community-gathered data on people-powered distribution sites via API (application programming interface) to anyone who wants to integrate it into their website or app.</p><br>

            <p>We'll post documentation for our API here by February 22nd. Please check back to register for an API key and start developing using community-gathered data.</p>
