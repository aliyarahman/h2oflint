            <br>{% trans "We are a Flint-based, community-led, media-centered start-up. The concept for this digital platform was made by “subterranean” community and grassroots leaders and Flint residents who have been physically serving people affected by the crisis for the last several months through various community-operated distribution hubs. Our aim is to leverage technology to change the human condition, to make sure all residents have access to receive the resources, information, and services they need, want, and deserve. Flint H2O was launched on February 24, 2016." %}</p>

            <br>{% trans "Months into the crisis, the City of Flint, Michigan continues in a state of emergency over water. To a significant segment of our population, there also continues to be a lack of coordination, communication, and centralization of pertinent Water Crisis information being readily, reliably, available to the people of Flint. We hope this digital online platform will help us all get and give the help that is needed." %}</p><br>

Governmental entities and educational institutions are also invited to use this site. Most especially, this site was designed to serve those who Darnell Ishmel refers to as the City’s ‘subterranean populations’ – those of us who exist well below the grassroots. We, down here, need it the most. We are the ones most marginalized, most neglected, and most affected by this crisis. Technology should help make us all equal. It is 2016. There should be no digital divide." %}</p><br>
