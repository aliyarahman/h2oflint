        <h3>What is FlintH2O</h3>
            <p><b>“A first-world solution to a third-world situation.”</b>
            <br>We are a Flint-based, community-led, media-centered start-up. The concept for this digital platform was made by “subterranean” community and grassroots leaders and Flint residents who have been physically serving people affected by the crisis for the last several months through various community-operated distribution hubs. Our aim is to leverage technology to change the human condition, to make sure all residents have access to receive the resources, information, and services they need, want, and deserve. Flint H2O was launched on February 24, 2016.</p>

            <p><b>“An essential part of any sensible, sustainable, long-term plan for water distribution, crowd-sourced intelligence, and economic development.”</b>
            <br>Months into the crisis, the City of Flint, Michigan continues in a state of emergency over water. To a significant segment of our population, there also continues to be a lack of coordination, communication, and centralization of pertinent Water Crisis information being readily, reliably, available to the people of Flint. We hope this digital online platform will help us all get and give the help that is needed.</p><br>

        <h3>Who built this web app?</h3>
            <p>In response to the ongoing water crisis in the city, Darnell Ishmel, a Flint resident, has led the development of an innovative, web-based, digital online platform to effectively coordinate fresh water intake and distribution efforts.</p>

            <p>For their trustworthy vision, indomitable tenacity, boundless creativity and unwavering support, we offer special thanks to our team: Dorian Jackson, Teresa Bingman, Maggie Ishmel, Quavon Kelly, Kasandra Wall, Jamale Ishmel, Brandon Townsel, Brandi Natale, Robert McCathern, Barbara Meadows, Samantha Parsons, and Aliya Rahman.</p><br>

            <p>We'd also like to thank our beta testers for helping us build a strong website: Lynn Nestor, Karl Kumodzi, Candace Johnson, Rodd Monts, Maggie Ishmel, Sharon Scott, Pam Magee, Kara Royal, Russell Kirksey, Mary Hammond, Jessica Tucker, Peter Heggs, Nicole Nelson, Komesia, Sherry Laurence, Neel W, Paul Mathis, Rebecca Eaddy, Tracy Ann Threat, Cheryl Ward, Sequina DuBose, Timothy Holley, Lynn Luelen, Joanne Baek, Melody Wilson, Michelle Wilson</p>


        <h3>Who is this site for?</h3>
            <p>FlintH2o is for EVERYONE inside and outside of Flint, Michigan - including individuals, grassroots and Faith-Based organizations, non-profit organizations, and for profit businesses. Governmental entities and educational institutions are also invited to use this site. Most especially, this site was designed to serve those who Darnell Ishmel refers to as the City’s ‘subterranean populations’ – those of us who exist well below the grassroots. We, down here, need it the most. We are the ones most marginalized, most neglected, and most affected by this crisis. Technology should help make us all equal. It is 2016. There should be no digital divide.</p><br>

        <h3>Who are our partners?</h3>
            <p>We may be dealing with this water situation for a long time to come. We are encouraged to know that there are companies in Flint and beyond, that have partnered with us so that we can help provide access to quality information, augment resource distribution, creating new job opportunities, and restore people to a quality of life they deserve.</p>
 
            <p><b>FlintH2o</b> enjoys the partnership and support of: darnellishmelmedia, Elite Career Solutions, the Urban Renaissance Center, Voices for Flint, the Black Success Network, New World Flood, the C.H.A.N.G.E. Foundation, and Color of Change.</p><br>
